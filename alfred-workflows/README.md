# Intro

These are workflows I have created which I find useful. Please do use them, BUT (!!!) you need to read the instructions. Most of them require some extra setup outside of just importing the Alfred workflow.

# Microphone Mute Toggle

## What it does

This workflow allows you to mute and un-mute your microphone with the press of a hotkey, regardless of what application is open.

This is useful if you have a Zoom call in the background while you multi-task in another application, but still need to turn your microphone on and off.

## Setup

This one is easy - just import the workflow.

## Use

Press Cmd+Ctrl+Option+K. You will see a message pop up like this:
