# Intro

These are workflows I have created which I find useful. Please do use them, BUT (!!!) you need to read the instructions. Most of them require some extra setup outside of just importing the Alfred workflow.

# Microphone Mute Toggle

## What it does

This workflow allows you to mute and un-mute your microphone with the press of a hotkey, regardless of what application is open.

This is useful if you have a Zoom call in the background while you multi-task in another application, but still need to turn your microphone on and off.

## Setup

This one is easy - just import the workflow.

## Use

Press Cmd+Ctrl+Option+K. You will see a message pop up like this:

# Cisco VPN Auto-push

## What it does

This workflow automates the process of reconnecting your VPN. It opens Cisco VPN, types "push" as the password, and presses Enter. This allows you to reconnect your VPN without ever taking your hands off the keyboard.

## Setup

Open your Cisco VPN settings by pulling up the UI, clicking the App name in the top bar and choosing preferences. Set them as such:

![Cisco VPN settings](cisco-vpn-settings.png)

...then import the workflow.

## Use

Press your Alfred shortcut keys and type "cv" (as in "connect VPN") as keyword.
